## Personality Insight

This program uses Watson API's Personality Insight and twitter to give personality insights between two users based on their tweets.

In the case here, I used the last 1200 tweets from both candidates, Hillary and Donald Trump to find their similarities in 5 traits:

* Dutifulness

* Anxiety

* Excitement-seeking

* Cautiousness

* Anger
